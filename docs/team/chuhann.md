## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Project Overview 
DOMNUS - is a desktop application that helps in module and task tracking. It was developed under the module CS2113 Software Engineering & Object Oriented Programming. Within the schedule of approximately 7 weeks, my team of 5 Computer Engineering students successfully created DOMNUS to help students to stay organize with respective to the modules they take in NUS. 

## 2. Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project. 

### 2.1 Enhancements Implemented: 

New Feature: Reminder
* Added reminder function

<br>
Highlights:
This feature can be further integrated to remind top 10 tasks in the future
<br>

<br>

New Feature: Snooze
* Added snooze function
<br> 
What it does:
Allows the user to delay the "pop up" message by "snoozing" it
<br>
Justification:
Reminder "pop up" message can be a little annoying if it comes up every 5 minutes, hence this feature gives user an option to delay the "pop up" message
<br>
Highlights:
Snooze feature can be improved by adding more fields to cater for more options
<br>
Credits (optional):

<br>

New Feature: Focus
* Added focus function
<br> 
What it does:
Allows the user to change context to "todo", "event", "deadline", "task", "mod", "selected" or "taken"
<br>
Justification:
Instead of viewing a whole list of combined tasks, changing context to specific task such as "todo" only lists on "todo" stuff and makes viewing of tasks neater
<br>
Highlights:
This feature can be enhanced to change the context to multiple context such as "todo" and "event" in the future
<br>
Credits (optional): 
@tomlbz for fixing the bugs and code quality
<br>
