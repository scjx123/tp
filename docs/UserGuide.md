## Introduction

Domsun is a CLI program that allows users to manage tasks and modules. <br>
Users will be able to browse and select modules, create and arrange tasks, add tasks to modules,<br>
create reminders and calculate their MCs / CAPs.

## Quick Start


1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `Duke` from [Our Release Page](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.0).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Mobile Nusmod.
4. Open the Command Prompt if you are running on Windows or Terminal if you are running on Mac OS. 
5. Navigate to your home folder and type ‘java -jar domnus.jar’
6. Type ‘bye’ to terminate your session.  


## Features 

#### Addition and removal of tasks
The program allows user to add or delete tasks from the task list.<br>
The program also provides shortcuts such as the `clear` command to delete tasks quickly.

#### Mark tasks as done or undone
The program allows user to mark tasks as done (denoted by `[V]`) or undone (denoted by `[X]`).

#### List tasks and reorder them by their ***date*** field
The program allows user to list tasks in ascending order or descending order with respect to their ***date*** values.<br>
The program also allows the user to filter the task list and only display tasks within a specified date.

#### Deadlines, Events and ToDo's
The program allows user to create 3 different kinds of tasks, *deadlines*, *events* and *todos*.<br>
*deadline* and *event* consists of both *description* and *time*, while *todo* does not contain *time*.<br>
The *time* field consists of a *date* part (such as `Oct 13 1998`), and a *time* part (such as `00:00`).<br>

#### Fuzzy parsing
The program fuzzily parses user's inputs with respect to date and time.<br>
`"Oct 13 1998"`, `10/13/98`, `13-10-1998`, `13 Oct 98` and many more common date formats are all supported.<br>
`1:1:0`, `01:01:00`, `1:01`, `01:1` and many more common time formats are all supported.

#### Auto-save and auto-load
The program saves the tasks list automatically every time the list changes. <br>
When the program loads up, it looks for the last saved tasks list first and tries to load it.

#### Syntax reminder
The program can remind the user of the syntax of a command if the command is correct but wrong syntax is present.

#### Module operations
The program allows users to list modules, mark modules as taken or untaken, and score grades for each module.

#### Find function
The program allows users to find items (tasks or modules) by keyword using the `find` command. 

#### Dynamic target
The program operates data dynamically. Users can operate on items as-is in the displayed sequence,<br>
and need not follow the sequence of task creation or module addition.

#### GUI inside CLI
The program has a GUI mode that accomplishes a GUI-like CLI interface using the ansi escape code sequence.<br> 
The user can use `fancy` to switch to the GUI mode and use `plain` to switch to plain text CLI mode.

#### Link tasks to Modules
The program allows users to add some tasks to modules using the `add` command.

#### Reminders
The program allows user to set reminders at certain time, or remind themselves of the most urgent tasks on start-up.

## Usage (alphabetical order)

### `add` - Add task to module

Typing `add` adds specified task(s) to specified module(s).

Syntax:

`add -task [index(es)] -mod [module code(s)]`

Example of usage: 

`add -task 1 2 -mod CS2113 CS2113T`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
    I have added the specified tasks to the specified modules.

`./data/duke.txt`, and then quitting the program.

Example of usage: 

`bye`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
    ____________________________________________________________

    ____________________________________________________________
        Name: list
        Description: Print a list of items depending on the current Focus
        Syntax:
        list
        list date [asc / desc / spec "date"(any common date format)]

    ____________________________________________________________

   ```

### `list` - Print a list of added tasks

Typing `list` commands the program to print either all added tasks or tasks at a specified *date*.<br>
The user can also control how the tasks printed are ordered with respect to *date*:<br>

The `asc` parameter tells the program to list tasks in ascending order with respect to their *date* field.<br>
The `desc` parameter tells the program to list tasks in descending order with respect to their *date* field.<br>
The `spec` parameter tells the program to only list tasks with the specified value of the *date* field.<br>

Note: with each execution of the `list` command, the indices of all tasks will be 
dynamically changed to refer to the task in the current list with the current indices.<br>
In other words, indices of tasks are not tied to their sequence of creation, allowing the user
to use commands much more flexibly, especially with the `find` command or the reordering parameters.

Syntax:

`list` <br> `list date [asc / desc / spec "date"]`, where `"date"` can be in any common date format.

Example of usage: 

`list`

Expected outcome:

   ```

        1.[D][X] math exam (by: Oct 15 2020 10:30)
        2.[D][X] CS exam (by: Oct 18 2020 15:00)
        3.[E][X] exam review session (at: Oct 01 2020 08:00)
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

Example of usage: 

`list date asc`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        Here is the list of tasks:
        1.[E][X] exam review session (at: Oct 01 2020 08:00)
        2.[D][X] math exam (by: Oct 15 2020 10:30)
        3.[D][X] CS exam (by: Oct 18 2020 15:00)
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

   ```

### `unknown` - Prints error message

Typing `unknown` or any string that is not a command will trigger the `unknown` command.<br>
The `unknown` command prints an error message for debug purposes, it is also the default behaviour of the program
when it fails to recognize the user's command. <br>

Note: If the program recognizes the command successfully, yet fails to find required parameters, 
it will not trigger this `unknown` command. It will print a syntax error and remind the user of
the correct syntax instead.

    ____________________________________________________________
    I have marked these modules as not taken:
    Module: CS2113T
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

### Triggering the syntax reminder

Typing a correct command with wrong syntax will trigger the syntax reminder.
