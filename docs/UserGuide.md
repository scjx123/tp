## Preliminaries

### Installation

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `Domsun` from [Our Release Page](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/releases).
3. If you are on Mac or Linux platforms, please ignore Step 4 to Step 6. 
4. If you are on Windows platform, we recommend using ***Windows Terminal*** instead of cmd.exe:<br>
![windows terminal](Images/winTerm.png)
<br>If you do not have Windows Terminal, try it out! It is fast and powerful, and enables the full features
of ANSI text rendering by default, which our Domsun will be utilising.
5. If you insist on using `cmd.exe` as your terminal on Windows, it also works, but you need 
 some extra work by doing the following steps:
    - Type `regedit` in your Search box, and click `Run as Administrator`:<br>
    ![regedit](Images/regedit.png)
    <br>You can use other methods
    to open your registry editor as well.
    - Locate `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console`:<br>
    ![hkey console](Images/hkeyConsole.png)
    - Create a new `DWORD` entry in the registry table (right click on the right) named `VirtualTerminalLevel` 
    if it is not present yet:<br>
    ![dword](Images/dword.png)
    - Right click on the value you have just created, and click on **`Modify`**:<br>
    ![dwordmod](Images/dwordMod.png)
    - Modify the value to be `00000001`:<br>
    ![dwdvalue](Images/dwdvalue.png)
6. Restart your cmd.exe by closing all cmd windows and re-open cmd.
    - *What did you just do?*
        1. You just enabled programs opened through cmd.exe to inherit ANSI rendering options from cmd.exe, which
        is by default off. (The ANSI rendering for cmd.exe itself is by default ***on***.)
        1. Microsoft used to enable this inheritance option by default. It is completely harmless.
        1. However, in recent Windows versions Microsoft decided to move this feature over to their
        newly developed Windows Terminal (which is cross-platform and more advanced. Yes it supports Linux commands as well).
    - *Why do you need such an option?*
        1. ANSI escape codes are responsible for the colors and font settings in terminal applications.
        2. That is how the `htop` in Linux shows a colored UI.
        3. Without enabling this option, all colors and fonts will return to their original form in plain text, 
        something like this:<br>
        ![ansi](Images/ansicodes.png)<br>
        4. We believe that you will be more comfortable with the option on... something like this:<br>
        ![newui](Images/newUI.png)<br>
    - *What if you failed to do the previous steps?*
        1. No worries. Our Domsun starts up in plain text mode by default on Windows platform, so you will see something like this:<br>
        ![textui](Images/textui.png)<br>
        2. The plain ui is perfectly usable with exactly the same functionalities as the colored one.
        3. If you have succeeded in following the previous steps, you should be able to type `fancy` command to switch
        to the colored UI, and type `plain` command to switch back to plain text.
        4. More on commands later :)
7. Congratulations! You're all set!

> Java 11 and above is highly recommended, although Domsun might run on a lower version.

### Running the program

Open your command line or terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the jar file (e.g., `~/downloads`). 
Then simply run the command `java -jar domsun.jar`:

```batch
$ cd ~/downloads
$ ls 
domsun.jar
$ java -jar domsun.jar
```

> Note: You can also run Domsun by double clicking the `domsun.jar` file directly.

### Domsun Tutorial 
As a beginning, here is how Domsun works. It has 3 lists that you should take note of as shown below. (The lists shown are non-exhaustive, as there are other dynamic lists that are created based on the `focus` command. Do refer to `focus` section of this User Guide for more details). 
![here](Images/Overview1.PNG)

1. `focus` command focuses the app onto the list of tasks that you currently have. 
2. Likewise, `focus mod` focuses the app on the entire list of modules available in NUS, while `focus taken` is the list of taken modules of your choice. 
3. To add a task under a module, you may enter the command `add -task 1 3 -mod CS2113`. 1 and 3 here are indices of the tasks in the task list. So be sure to have some task added BEFORE typing this command. 
4. To mark a module as 'taken', you may enter `take CS2113 CS1010` while focusing on the module list by using `focus mod`. alternatively, you may use the indices method as before such as `take 1 4` to take the 1st and 2nd module available on the module list. 
5. The `list` commands follows the app's current focus. If it is focusing on list of tasks, typing `list` will show all tasks. Likewise for modules and taken. 
6. Typing `detail 1` when focusing on tasks list, will display the 1st index, task details. 
7. Note that `detail 2` here will display different results as the two indices of 2 represent different modules! The one on the left represents CG2027 while the one on the right represent CS1010. 

**A point to note before venturing into the libraries of commands that we have.**<br>
You can switch between fancy mode display, and plain display anytime during the program. 
During `list` command, you will be able to toggle between pages of fancy by using `prev` and `next`
However, the current version of fancy mode is still in beta, hence, it is expected to not be able to fully display certain commands that are too long. such as `help`, `detail`,`mc` etc. Do look forward to the next update!

## Features 

### Addition and removal of tasks
The program allows user to add or delete tasks from the task list.<br>
The program also provides shortcuts such as the `clear` command to delete tasks quickly.

### Mark tasks as done or undone
The program allows users to mark tasks as done (denoted by `[V]`) or undone (denoted by `[X]`).

### List tasks and reorder them by their ***date*** field
The program allows users to list tasks in ascending order or descending order with respect to their ***date*** values.<br>
The program also allows the user to filter the task list and only display tasks within a specified date.

### Deadlines, Events, and ToDo's
The program allows users to create 3 different kinds of tasks, *deadlines*, *events*, and *todos*.<br>
*deadline* and *event* consists of both *description* and *time*, while *todo* does not contain *time*.<br>
The *time* field consists of a *date* part (such as `Oct 13 1998`), and a *time* part (such as `00:00`).<br>

### Fuzzy parsing
The program fuzzily parses user's inputs with respect to date and time.<br>
Supports any date format delimited by `" "`, `-` and `/`, with days, months and years in any order, such as 
`"Oct 13 1998"`, `13/10/1998` and `1998-10-13`.<br>
Supports any time format delimited by `:` in 1 or 2 digits, such as
`1:1:0`, `01:01:00`, `1:01` and `01:1`. Does not support the notations "am" or "pm".

### Auto-save and auto-load
The program saves the tasks list automatically every time the list changes. <br>
When the program loads up, it looks for the last saved tasks list first and tries to load it.

### Syntax reminder
The program can remind the user of the syntax of a command if the command is correct but the wrong syntax is present.

### Module operations
The program allows users to list modules, mark modules as taken or untaken, and score grades for each module.

### Find function
The program allows users to find items (tasks or modules) by keyword using the `find` command. 

### Dynamic target
The program operates data dynamically. Users can operate on items as-is in the displayed sequence,<br>
and need not follow the sequence of task creation or module addition.

### GUI inside CLI
The program has a GUI mode that accomplishes a GUI-like CLI interface using the ANSI escape code sequence.<br> 
The user can use `fancy` to switch to the GUI mode and use `plain` to switch to plain text CLI mode.

### Link tasks to Modules
The program allows users to add some tasks to modules using the `add` command.

### Reminders
The program allows users to set reminders at a certain time, or remind themselves of the most urgent tasks on start-up.

## Usage

## Features - Daily Tasks 

### `todo` - Add a to-do task to the task list

Typing `todo` allows the program to parse the user's input and create a ***todo*** object with 
specified *description*. It will be appended to the end of the task list.<br>

Notes: 
1. Todo description parameter here is compulsory.

Syntax:

`todo [description]`

Example of usage: 

`todo class`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________

        [T][X] class
        Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

### `deadline` - Add a deadline to the task list

Typing `deadline` allows the program to parse the user's input and create a ***deadline*** object with 
specified *description* and *time*. It will be appended to the end of the task list. <br>

Notes: 
1. Deadline description and time parameters here are compulsory.

Syntax: 

`deadline [description] -by [time]`

Example of usage:

`deadline ddl -by 21/9/15 1:12`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        Got it. I've added this task:
        [D][X] ddl (by: Sep 15 2021 01:12)
        Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

### `event` - Add an event to the task list

Typing `event` allows the program to parse the user's input and create an ***event*** object with 
specified *description* and *time*. It will be appended to the end of the task list. <br>

Notes: 
1. Event description and time parameters here are compulsory.

Syntax:

`event [description] -at [time]`

Example of usage: 

`event midterm exam -at May 13 2020 8:00`

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        Got it. I've added this task:
        [E][X] midterm exam (at: May 13 2020 08:00)
        Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

### `list` - Print a list of added tasks

Typing `list` commands the program to print either all added tasks or tasks at a specified *date*.<br>
The user can also control how the tasks printed are ordered with respect to *date*:<br>

The `asc` parameter tells the program to list tasks in ascending order with respect to their *date* field.<br>
The `desc` parameter tells the program to list tasks in descending order with respect to their *date* field.<br>
The `spec` parameter tells the program to only list tasks with the specified value of the *date* field.<br>

Notes: 
1. When updates are done on the list (e.g : new "todo" task is added), "list" need to be run again to see the result of the update. 
2. There are 2 main list in this application (i.e. task and module list). For more explanation, refer to the diagram on "Domsun Tutorial" on the UserGuide. 

Syntax:

`list` <br> `list date [asc / desc / spec "date"]`, where `"date"` can be in any common date format.

Example of usage: 

`list`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        Here is the list of tasks:
        1.[D][X] math exam (by: Oct 15 2020 10:30)

    ____________________________________________________________
   ```


### `done` - Mark a task as done

Typing `done` allows the user to mark the task at a specified *index* as **done**.<br>
Note: 
1. *index* can be an integer number or a letter (`A` or `a` corresponds to 1).<br>      
2. If the index starts with a letter, it will be treated as a numerical value mapped A to 1 and Z to 26. For example, "done apple" is equivalent to "done 1" and "done C4" is equivalent to "done 3".

Syntax:

`done [index]`

Example of usage: 

`done 1`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        Nice! I've marked this task as done:
        [D][V] ddl (by: Sep 15 2021 01:12)
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```


### `undone` - Mark a task as undone

Typing `undone` allows the user to mark the task at a specified *index* as **undone**.<br>
Note:
1. *index* can be an integer number or a letter (`A` or `a` corresponds to 1).<br>
2. If the index starts with a letter, it will be treated as a number mapped A to 1 and Z to 26. For example: "undone apple" is equivalent to "undone 1" and "undone C4" is equivalent to "undone 3".

Syntax:

`undone [index]`

Example of usage: 

`undone 1`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        Nice! I've marked this task as undone:
        [D][X] math exam (by: Oct 15 2020 10:30)
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```


### `find` - Find an event in the task list

Typing `find` commands the program to search through the task list and print all tasks with the
specified *keyword*. If there is no task with such a *keyword*, `[NOT FOUND]` will be printed instead.

Notes: 
1. Keyword here means any word (time/description) on task list. 
2. Ensure that you are referring to the most updated task list. 
3. If keyword does not exist on the task list, a "no found" message will be shown. 

Syntax:

`find [keyword]`

Example of usage: 

`find exam`

Expected outcome (found):

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        Tasks with the specified keyword are:
        1.[D][X] math exam (by: Oct 15 2020 10:30)
        2.[D][X] CS exam (by: Oct 18 2020 15:00)
        3.[E][X] exam review session (at: Oct 01 2020 08:00)
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

Expected outcome (not found):

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        Tasks with the specified keyword are:
        [NOT FOUND]
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

### `postpone` - Postpone a task by index

Typing `postpone` delays a task specified by the user or by default a day.<br>
Note: 
1. Option `h` for an hour. Option `w` for a week. Option `y` for a year.<br>
2. The tasks should consist of date type i.e. events or deadline tasks, do not work on todo tasks.<br>
3. Each postpones delays the tasks by a day, an hour, a week or a year.<br>
4. Does not work with custom date unless you have updated the task with the preferred date format.<br>
5. When a letter appears without a number as its parameter, the letter will be treated as a numeric value mapped A to 1 and Z to 26. For example, "postpone boy" is equivalent to "postpone 2" and "postpone h" is equivalent to "postpone 8".<br>

Syntax:

`postpone [index]` <br>
`postpone (h/w/y) [index]` 

Example of usage:

`postpone 1`

Expected outcome:
 
    
    _________________________________________________________
        I've postpone this task:
        [D][X] project submission (by: Sep 16 2021 01:12)
    ____________________________________________________________
    

Example of usage:

`postpone h 1`

Expected outcome:
    
    
    ____________________________________________________________
        I've postpone this task:
        [D][X] project submission (by: Sep 16 2021 02:12)
    ____________________________________________________________
    

Example of usage:

`postpone w 1`

Expected outcome:

    
    ____________________________________________________________
        I've postpone this task:
        [D][X] project submission (by: Sep 23 2021 02:12)
    ____________________________________________________________
    

Example of usage:

`postpone y 1`

Expected outcome:

    
    ____________________________________________________________
        I've postpone this task:
        [D][X] project submission (by: Sep 23 2022 02:12)
    ____________________________________________________________
    


### `reminder` - Print tasks that are due soon

Typing `reminder` prints the tasks that are due within a certain time range or to activate the reminder.<br>

Notes: 
1. The reminder popup is set by default to emerge every 5 minutes.  

Syntax:

`reminder` <br>
`reminder [on/off]`

### `grade` - Add grade to course or module

Typing `grade` allows the user to add a grade to the user's taken course or module.<br>
Note: 
1. Modules need to be "taken" first before a grade is applied.<br>
2. Grade and module code/index are compulsory parameters.<br>
3. Grades and module code need to be acceptable grades and modules in NUS. For example: If "grade CS2113 Z" or "grade CS9999 A" is input, an error message will be displayed.

    ____________________________________________________________
    

### `goal` - Calculate how far the user is from his or her target CAP

Typing `goal` allows the user to calculate how far the user is from his/her target CAP.<br>
Note: 
1. All values on the parameters should be a positive integer. Otherwise, you should expect an error message.<br>
2. Both total MC and target CAP are compulsory parameters.<br>
3. CAP values need to be within 0 to 5.

Syntax:

`goal [-option] [total MC] [target CAP] {[taken MC] [current CAP]}` <br>

`option: -u(user's cap and mc), -c(custom cap and mc)`

Example of usage:

`goal -c 160 4.9 100 4.5`

Expected outcome:

    ____________________________________________________________
        Your required average CAP is: 5.57

Expected outcome:

    ____________________________________________________________
        Your required average CAP is: 4.89
        Jia you! :D
    ____________________________________________________________
    

### `mc` - Prints MCs

Typing `mc` prints the number of MCs based on the selected option. 
By default, this command focuses on the entire module list. In order to print the MC of taken modules, 
do remember to enter 'focus taken' before proceeding with this command. <br>
Note: 
1. Default mc command prints the total mc that exists in the list of taken modules.<br>
2. To print out a detailed list of mc belonging to the taken modules, ensure you have entered "focus taken". 

Syntax:

`mc [-option]` <br>
`option: -d(detailed)`

Example of usage (when there are modules in the target): 

`mc`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here is the total MC:
    22
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```
Example of usage (when there are modules in the target): 

`mc -d`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________

    EE1003: 4MCs
    EE1111: 6MCs
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

### `cap` - Prints CAPs

Typing `mc` prints the calculated CAP for courses based on the selected option.<br>
Note: 
1. Index should be a positive integer. Otherwise, you should expect an "invalid command" error message.<br>
2. You must reference existing tasks or modules when using this command. For example: If "list" shows only 2 tasks but you try to use "-task 3" as a parameter for "add", you should expect an "index out of range" error message because "3" is out of range for your task list. Similarly, if there is no mod called CS9999 in the module list and you try to use "-mod CS9999" as a parameter for "add", you should expect a "not found" error message.

Syntax:

`cap [-option] [module] [grade] {[module] [grade]...}`
`option: -u(user, default), -m(multiple/custom modules)`

Example of usage (when there are modules in the target): 

`cap`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here is your existing CAP: 4.00
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```
Example of usage (when there are modules in the target):

    Here is your existing CAP: 4.25
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```


## Features - General Features for both Daily Tasks & Module Planner

### `add` - Add task to module

Typing `add` adds specified task(s) to specified module(s).<br>
Note: 
1. Index should be a positive integer. Otherwise, you should expect an "invalid command" error message.<br>
2. You must reference EXISTING tasks or modules when using this command. For example: If "list" shows only 2 tasks but you try to use "-task 3" as a parameter for "add", you should expect an "index out of range" error message because "3" is out of range for your task list. Similarly, if there is no mod called CS9999 in the module list and you try to use "-mod CS9999" as a parameter for "add", you should expect a "not found" error message.<br>
3. Both parameters here (i.e. task and mod) are compulsory.<br>
4. Once a task is added to a module, it is unlinked from the task list.

Syntax:

`add -task [index(es)] -mod [module code(s)]`

Example of usage: 

`add -task 1 2 -mod CS2113 CS2113T`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
    I have added the specified tasks to the specified modules.
    CS2113 << tasks: borrow book; eat; 
    CS2113T << tasks: borrow book; eat; 
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

### `clear` - Clear the task list

Typing `clear` results in the program deleting all added tasks from the task list.<br>
Note: 
1. "clear fancy" can only be used in fancy UI mode.<br>
2. Extra inputs after "clear" will get an "invalid command" error unless it contains the word "fancy" (case insensitive). For example: "clear domsun" results in an "invalid command" error. If "clear fancy domsun" is input in, "domsun" will be ignored and "clear fancy" will be executed. If "clear MyFancyBoy" is input in, "clear fancy" will be executed.

Example of usage: 

`clear`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        Nice! I've cleared everything in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

### `delete` - Delete a task from the task list

Typing `delete` deletes the task with specified *index* from the current task list.<br>
Note: 
1. *index* should be an integer number or a letter (`A` or `a` corresponds to 1). Otherwise you should expect an error message.<br>
2. You must reference EXISTING tasks when using this command. For example: If "list" shows only 2 tasks but you try to use "delete 3", you should expect an "index out of range" error message because "3" is out of range for your task list.

Syntax:

`delete [index]`

Example of usage: 

`delete 1`

Expected outcome:

    
    ____________________________________________________________
        
    ____________________________________________________________
      

### `edit` - Modify attributes of an item

Typing `edit ` modifies the attributes of an task or module. <br>
Note: 
1. Fields for "-task" include "description", "type", "selected", "weekly" and "done".<br>
2. Fields for "-mod" include "grade", "su", "selected" and "taken".<br>
3. No space allowed around the "=" sign. Use "_" in for spaces in "[field=new_value]" parameters.<br>
4. Modules and task referenced need to exist.<br>
5. Removing a specified linked task from the module does not delete the task from the task list.

Syntax:

`edit [-mod / -task] [index / code (for module only)] [field=new value]`

`No space allowed around "=". Use "_" in place of space for the "[field=new value]" parameters`


Example of usage:
`edit -mod CS2113T grade=A`

Exepected outcome:
    
    ____________________________________________________________

### `focus` - Change the context of the program

Typing `focus` changes the context that all other commands are based on the specified target. <br>
If no parameter is provided, the program will focus on `task`. <br>
Other commands such as `list`, `done`, `sel`, etc. all operate based on the current focused context.

Notes: 
1. This function is used together with "list" to see the result of the "focus". 
2. For more explanation, refer to the diagram on "Domsun Tutorial" on the UserGuide. 

Syntax:

`focus`
`focus [deadline / todo / event / task / mod / selected / taken]`

Example of usage: 

`focus mod`

The fancy mode only shows correctly if your terminal supports ANSI escape codes.<br>
Note: 
1. This feature can be used on Linux or Mac only. Error numbers will be displayed on Windows.

Syntax:

`fancy`

Example of usage: 

`fancy`

Expected outcome:

the UI switches to fancy mode (GUI-like CLI interface).


### `plain` - Switch the UI to the plain mode

Typing `plain` switches the UI to the plain mode (pure-text CLI interface). <br>
This command has no effect if the UI is already in plain mode.<br>
The plain mode shows correctly on all terminals.<br>
Note: 
1. Extra inputs after "plain" will be ignored. For example: If "plain bye" is input in, "bye" will be ignored, and "plain" will be executed.

Syntax:

`plain`

Example of usage: 

`plain`

Expected outcome:

The UI switches to plain mode (pure-text CLI interface).


### `next` - Switch the target region to the next page

Typing `next` switches the target region to the next page, should a next page exist.<br>
This command has no effect on pure text CLI mode.<br>
Note: 
1. This function should be used in FANCY UI only.

Syntax:

`next [region]` <br>
`region: i(item list), s(selection), a(all, default)`

Example of usage: 

`next`

Expected outcome ***(GUI mode only)***:

Both regions of the GUI are switched to the next page if the next page is available.

Example of usage: 

`next i`

Expected outcome ***(GUI mode only)***:

The item list region (top) of the GUI is switched to the next page if the next page is available.


### `prev` - Switch the target region to the previous page

### `unknown` - Prints error message

Typing `unknown` or any string that is not a command will trigger the `unknown` command.<br>
The `unknown` command prints an error message for debugging purposes, it is also the default behavior of the program
when it fails to recognize the user's command. <br>

Note: 
If the program recognizes the command successfully, yet fails to find the required parameters, 
it will not trigger this `unknown` command. It will print a syntax error and remind the user of
the correct syntax instead.

Syntax:

`unknown` <br> `[anything that is not a command]`

Example of usage: 

`who is duke?`

Expected outcome:

   ```  
    ____________________________________________________________
        OOPS, I don't know what that means :-( Try "help"!
    ____________________________________________________________
   ```

### `bye` - Quit the program

Typing `bye` results in the program saving the current task list to a local file named 
`./data/duke.txt`, and then quit the program.
Note: 
1. Extra inputs after "bye" will be ignored. For example: If "bye domsun" is input in, "domsun" will be ignored, and "bye" will be executed.
