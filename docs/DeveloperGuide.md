## 2. Introduction
Domsun is a CLI program that allows users to manage tasks and modules. <br>
Users will be able to browse and select modules, create and arrange tasks, add tasks to modules,<br>
create reminders and calculate their MCs / CAPs.

## 3. Setting Up
1. **Configure Intellij for JDK 11**, as described [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html).
1. **Import the project _as a Gradle project_**, as described [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html).
1. **Verify the set up**: After the importing is complete, locate the `src/main/java/seedu/duke/Domnus.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Domnus.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below:
   ```

    > Task :compileJava UP-TO-DATE
    > Task :processResources UP-TO-DATE
    > Task :classes UP-TO-DATE
    
    > Task :Domnus.main()
    	____________________________________________________________
    		Hello, I'm Domnus. What can I do for you?
    	____________________________________________________________
    	____________________________________________________________
    		Here are the tasks due within 3 days: 
    		No task within 3 days from now
    	____________________________________________________________

   ```
   
 Type  `bye` to ensure there is no error saving or creating a new file when exiting. Re-launch and type `help` for all commands available in the program. 

## 4. Design

### 4.1 Architecture
The **Architecture Diagram** below represents a high-level design overview of the App. Specifically, it is done with an N-tier architectural style, where the higher layers make use of services provided by lower layers. 

![here](Images/Architecture_Diagram.PNG)

As shown in the above diagram, user only interacts with the UI layer and their commands, in turn will be passed to next adjacent layer. Given below is a quick overview of each component. 

**4.2 Main Layer**<br>
The `main` layer, it contains a single class known as `Domnus`. Its purpose can be split into 3 parts: 

At Start Up: It calls upon the `storage` component to load user's past data and it also loads the complete module list that is packaged inside the JAR file. <br>
At Operating: It connects the relevant component of the program to ensure the program is operating as per the intended logic flow. <br>
At Shutdown: It exits the running loop of the program to shutdown the program successfully. <br>

**4.3 UI Layer**<br>
Main gets user input and displays messages through the use of UI component. 
The UI layer entails the package *visualize*, which contains classes *ColoredString*, *Bitmap*, *UI*, *Cli*, 
*FancyCli* and enumerations *Color* and *Sprite* in the following structure:
![uml](Images/Package%20visualize.png)

UI's interaction with user<br>
UI gets user input through *nextline()*, and renders strings as a user-comprehensible interface through 
*update(String, Data)*.

UI's interaction with the rest of the program<br>
UI passes the user's input string out to the DOMNUS object, which then passes the string to the Command Interpreter layer.
UI also reads data from the Data object for refreshing purposes, but does not modify it. 

**4.4 Command Interpreter Layer**<br>
Upon receiving command from the UI, DOMNUS would pass the entire user input into Command Interpreter (CI)

**4.5 Execute Layer**<br>
The `Execute` layer carries out the relevant actions required based on the analyzed input. All of the features in the program are stored under this layer which is under the package name `command`. To summarize, this layer is responsible for: 

1) Match the user's command to the relevant actions.
2) Throw any exception based on errorneous user input/invalid conditions. 

**4.6 Storage Layer**<br>
The `Storage` layer loads, saves, and do pre-data processing before performing the two aforementioned action. It is active in 2 phases. 

During loading phase: 
1) For the user's task: This layer translates the previously (if any) saved data format into recognizable commands and loads these data as per how the app functions during runtime. 
2) For the module list: This layer conducts simple parsing of the text file containing all the modules and stores them creates individual item known as `SingleModule` before loading them into an arraylist. 

During saving phase: 
1) For the user's task: This layer saves any changes that the user made to the task list onto a text file. 
2) For the module list: This layer saves any module marked `TAKEN` by the user onto a text file, together with the relevant module information such as module's code, and grade attained (if any).  

**4.7 Flow of DOMSUN**<br>
The sequence diagram below shows the main interaction of classes with each other throughout the whole lifecycle of DOMSUM.

## 5. Implementation<br>
This section highlights some of our project's key feature and its implementation. 

### 5.1 Take Feature
The take mechanism is facilitated by the `TakeAction` class and is extensively used by other classes via inheritance. 
The take mechanism does the following: Comprehends user input and generate target identifiers, 
filters the targets from data, and performs the specified operations on the targets. 
The `TakeAction` class extends `Action` class, 
and internally it stores an arraylist of `Item` object in `targetBackup` field to restore the disruptions to the 
`data` object. Additionally, it implements the following operation: 

 - `prepare()` - Interpret the `ParamNode` arguments and creates target identifiers for the `act()` function. 
 In `TakeAction` the identifiers are `ArrayList` objects, `codes` and `indices`. 
 - `act()`- Get the target items from `data` based on identifiers, do `modifyObject()` on each target, and return a 
 `String` as the execution result for this action.
 - `modifyObject()` - Performs the actual operation of modifying the target item. In `TakeAction`, it assigns the 
 `isTaken` field of the target item as `true`.
 - `getObjectInfo()` - Controls what is the text representation of the target object in the return string.
 - `safetyCheck()`- Sets the `isBlind` flag if user's input has a void parameter tree, thereby specifying the default 
 mode of action for this command. 
 - `superAct()` - Returns `super.Act()`. Used as the break out node in the prototype chain for the inherited classes 
 to be able to call the method `Act()` of the ancestor. In child classes of `TakeAction`, this method can be overloaded
 to return `super.superAct()` to start the upward propogation.
 - `superPrepare()` - Returns `super.Prepare()`. Used as the break out node in the prototype chain for the inherited 
 classes to be able to call the method `Prepare()` of the ancestor. In child classes of `TakeAction`, this method can 
 be overloaded to return `super.superPrepare()` to start the upward propogation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the take mechanism behaves at each step. 

Step 1. The user enters `take 1 2 CS2113`. Once the execute layer (`Command` object) executes the message and calls 
`action.prepare()`, `TakeAction` will begin its `prepare()` operation.

Step 2. `prepare()` calls its prototype and extracts information from the `ParamNode` tree.

Step 3. `prepare()` checks if the command has a void parameter tree. If so, it calls the `safetyCheck()` method to 
 perform the default operation (sets the `isBlind` flag and ensure that the `act()` will execute in the `blind` 
 mode in this case). Otherwise, it parses the user parameters into `codes` or `indices` depending on 
 the most probable interpretations, and throws a custom exception `CommandException` object in case of exceptions.
 In this case, `1` and `2` will be added to `indices` and `CS2113` will be added to `codes`.

Step 4. Next, execute layer will call `action.act()` which causes `TakeAction` to begin its `act()` operation.

Step 5. `act()` stores the current state of the `data` object into its `flag` field and `targetBackup` field to prevent 
unwanted changes to the `data` object.

Step 6. `act()` enters either the `blind` mode or the `normal` mode depending on the value of `isBlind`.

Step 7. If in `blind` mode, `act()` filters out all items in `data` by using the `blindSearch` flag. 
In this case this flag is set to `Constants.SELECTED` to search through all selected items. In the children classes
of `TakeAction`, however, this variable may be reset to other values to have different blind search behaviours. 
Otherwise, in `normal` mode, `act()` filters out items from `data` based on identifiers, 
in this case `codes` and `indices`.

Step 8. `act()` loops through all filtered items and calls `modifyObject()` on each of them.

Step 9. `modidyObject()` modifies the objects of interest, in this case by setting the `isTaken` field to true.

Step 10. Depending on the result of `modifyObject()`, `act()` parses the suitable string for output through the use of 
a `StringBuilder` object, in the process calling `getObjectInfo()` to get the textual descriptions of the targets.

Step 11. `act()` restores the previous state to the `data` object using the `flag` field and the `targetBackup` field.

Step 12. `act()` replaces the string `Constants.TEXT_PLACEHOLDER` in the default output string for TakeAction 
defined in `Constants.messageMap` with the actual result string, and returns it.

**Design consideration:**

1. Reuseable - functions such as `modyfiObject()` can be overloaded in child classes to achieve different functions.
1. Low coupling - `prepare()` is not aware of the program `data`, and `act()` is not aware of the user input.
1. Uniform - `TakeAction` as well as all other actions have uniform input and outputs, and can be mapped 
indescriminatively to any `Command` object and executed indifferently.

**Aspect : How TakeAction executes**
 - **Alternative 1 (current choice):** calls `getTarget()` method of `data` object using different flags 
 to get wanted targets.
    - Pros: Easy to implement and easy to read. Easily extendable by adding more flags in the `getTarget()` method.
    - Cons: Slow. Everytime we `act()` on something, the `data` object needs to do the filtering again.
 - **Alternative 2:** Have many different lists or maps, each stores one category of data
    - Pros: Fast, no need filtering in most cases.
    - Cons: Harder to implement and extend. Everytime we want a new functionality we would need to create a new list.

### 5.2 Statistic Feature 
The statistic feature is facilitated by the StatsAction class. It extends `Action` class, and it functions under the architectural component `execute`. Internally, it stores an arraylist of Item object in `targetList`. This class implements the following operation: 

 - `prepare()` - Sets `isMod` flag according to user's 
 - `act()`- Gets `targetList` and calculates the raw ratio of the completed items.
 - `roundedRatioBar()`- Returns a rounded ratio enclosed in square brackets for printing. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the statistic mechanism behaves at each step. 

Step 1. The user enters `stats -mod CS2113`	once the execute layer executes the message and calls `action.prepare()` class, `StatsAction` will begin its `prepare()` operation

Step 2. `prepare()` looks at the input called `ParamNode args` which is user command processed by Command Intepreter layer, and starts to identify whether user has enter the keyword `mod ` if `userInput` contains the keyword, then `isMod` flag will be set. 

Step 3. Next, execute layer will call `action.act()` which causes StatsAction to begin its `act()` operation. If `isMod` flag is set, `act()` will search for the user specified module and get the list of tasks tagged to it.

Step 5. Once the list of task is obtain, the operation will loop through the task list and count the number of completed task followed by generating a ratio. 

Step 6. This ratio will be passed into `roundedRatioBar` to return *String* of a rounded ratio to 1 decimal place enclosing it in square brackets. 

Step 7. Now `StatsAction` is completed and it will return this string back to `Command` to store it under the String variable `result`. The `Main` layer will retrieve `result`, before passing it onto `UI` layer for printing. 

![statsDiagram](Images/StatsAction.png)

**Design consideration:**

**Aspect : How statistics executes**
 - **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate class and get list of tasks/taken modules' task and scan through them to calculate statistics
	 - Pros: Reduces Coupling and increase testability as a software unit itself. 
	 - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage 

 - **Alternative 2:** initialize statistics as zero and each task contains an aspect called statistics
	 - Pros: Will use less memory since the task itself will be deleted. 
	 - Cons: Stats will be updated constantly even though we do not need it. 

### 5.3 CAP calculator feature

This feature extends `Action` to execute command given by the user, output are then passed on to `Ui` for display. 
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CalculateCapAction#act()` - Calculate the user CAP based on stored user grades / input modules.
* `CalculateCapAction#prepare()` - Parse user command to suitable parameter for `CalculateCapAction#act()` function.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how thecap calculator mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `cap` command find his current CAP grade. Command is then parsed by `CalculateCapAction#prepare()` to be passed as arguments for `CalculateCapAction#act()`.

Step 2. `CalculateCapAction#act()` retrieves data from the stored user's grades.

Step 3. `CalculateCapAction#act()` then retrieves module data from the `modulelist.txt` to determine Modular Credit (MC) allocation.

Step 4. CAP value is calculated and returned to the user through `Ui`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
