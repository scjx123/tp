## 3. Design

### 3.1 Architecture
The **Architecture Diagram** below represents a high-level design overview of the App. Specifically, it is done with an **N-tier architectural style**, where the higher layers make use of services provided by lower layers. 

![here](Images/Architecture_Diagram.PNG)


**3.2 Main Layer**<br>
For the `main` layer, it contains a single class known as `Duke`. 

**3.3 UI Layer**<br>
Main gets user input and displays messages through the use of UI component. 
The UI layer entails the package *visualize*, which contains classes *ColoredString*, *Bitmap*, *UI*, *Cli*, 
*FancyCli* and enumerations *Color* and *Sprite* in the following structure:
![uml](Images/Package%20visualize.png)

UI's interaction with user<br>
UI gets user input through *nextline()*, and renders strings as a user-comprehensible interface through 
*update(String, Data)*.

UI's interaction with the rest of the program<br>
UI passes the user's input string out to the Duke object, which then passes the string to the Command Interpreter layer.
UI also reads data from the Data object for refreshing purposes, but does not modify it. 

**1.3 Command Interpreter Layer**<br>
Upon receiving command from the UI, Duke would pass the entire user input into Command Interpreter (CI)

**1.4 Execute Layer**<br>
Once CI processed the user input, duke proceeds to redirect the input to Execute for execution of action. 

**1.5 Storage Layer**<br>
Once CI processed the user input, duke proceeds to redirect the input to Execute for execution of action. 

**1.6 Flow of DOMSUN**<br>
The sequence diagram below shows the main interaction of classes with each other throughout the whole lifecycle of DOMSUM.
![uml](Images/DOMSUM_Main_Flow.png)

## 4. Implementation<br>
This section highlights some of our project's key feature and its implementation. 

### 4.1 Module Planner Feature

The module planner feature entails many *Actions* which extend `Action`. Their functionalities and usages
are in the table below:

|Table|To|Be|Filled|
|-----|---|---|------|
|blah|blah|blah|blah|

A typical flow of execution would be:
1. blah
1. blah
1. blah

### 4.2 Checker Feature 
![here](Images/Checker_Diagram.png)

The checker mechanism is facilitated by the utility class `Checker`. It is an independent class on its own without extensions and is stored under the `Data` package of our app. The class implements the following operations: 

 - `checkDuplicates()`- Calls the checkClash method and return the status of boolean variable `isClash` .
 - `checkClash(ArrayList< item >, Item)`- Updates `isClash` once a duplicate item is found in the list.
 - `checkRecurrenceDate(Task)` - Checks if the current date is beyond the stated date in the list, and provides a new update for the date recurring date.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the checker mechanism behaves at each step. 

Step 1. A new `Deadline` object is created and needs to be added to the existing list of task. Hence it calls `addTask()` method under `Data` class. 

Step 2. Data instantiates a Checker with its existing list by calling its constructor, and the task to be added to the list 

Step 3. Data proceeds to call the `checkRecurrenceDate(Task)` of the Checker class, to get a newDate if today's date is beyond the stated weekly date.
 
Step 4. If `newDate` is not `null`it shows that there is a new updated date. Therefore, we proceed to update the object with our updated weekly date. 

Step 5. Now we proceed to call `checkDuplicates()` of Checker class. 

Step 6. If `false` , there is no duplicates in the existing list, and the task can be safely added. Otherwise, no action will be taken. 

### 4.3 CAP calculator feature

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `CalculateCapAction`. It extends `Action` to execute command given by the user, output are then passed on to `Ui` for display. 
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CalculateCapAction#act()` - Calculate the user CAP based on stored user grades / input modules.
* `CalculateCapAction#prepare()` - Parse user command to suitable parameter for `CalculateCapAction#act()` function.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how thecap calculator mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `cap` command find his current CAP grade. Command is then parsed by `CalculateCapAction#prepare()` to be passed as arguments for `CalculateCapAction#act()`.

Step 2. `CalculateCapAction#act()` retrieves data from the stored user's grades.

Step 3. `CalculateCapAction#act()` then retrieves module data from the `modulelist.txt` to determine Modular Credit (MC) allocation.

Step 4. CAP value is calculated and returned to the user through `Ui`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![cap uml diagram](Images/Cap_Calculator_Diagram.JPG)


### 4.4 Reminder Feature

The proposed reminder mechanism is facilitated by `ReminderAction`. It extends `Action` and the output is passed onto `UI` for display. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ReminderAction#act()` — List out the deadlines and events tasks that are due within 3 days

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the reminder mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `reminder` command to list out tasks due within 3 days. Command is then parsed by `ReminderAction#act()`.

Step 2. `ReminderAction#act` retrieves tasklist data from the user's list

Step 3. `ReminderAction#act` then sorts the due dates in ascending order

Step 4: Tasks due within 3 days are returned to the user through Ui

The following sequence diagram diagram shows how the reminder operation works

![Reminder_Sequence_Diagram](Images/ReminderAction_Sequence_Diagram.png)

### 4.5 Remind Feature

Another proposed manual reminder mechanism is facilitated by `RemindAction`. It extends `Action` to execute command given by the user, output are then passed on to `Ui` for display. 
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `RemindAction#act()` - Set the reminder to be executed on the chosen time.
* `RemindAction#prepare()` - Parse user command to suitable parameter for `RemindAction#act()` function.
* `RemindAction#getSchedule` - Returns the schedule set by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the remind mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `remind [time]` command to set schedule for the reminder. Command is then parsed by `RemindAction#prepare()` to be passed as arguments for `RemindAction#act()`.

Step 2. `RemindAction#act()` calls `RemindAction#getSchedule` to pass the schedule later in `Ui`.

Step 3. The schedule is returned to the user through `Ui`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![Postpone_Sequence_Diagram](Images/Remind.png)

### 4.6 Snooze Feature

The proposed snooze mechanism is facilitated by `SnoozeAction`. It extends `Action` to execute command given by the user, output are then passed on to `Ui` for display. 
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `RemindAction#getNewInterval` - Returns the new interval set by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the snooze mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `snooze` command to snooze for the reminder. 

Step 2. `SnoozeAction#getNewInterval` sets and returns the new interval.

Step 3. The new interval is returned to the user through `Ui`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![Postpone_Sequence_Diagram](Images/Snooze.png)

### 4.7 Postpone Feature

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `PostponeAction`. It extends `Action` to execute command given by the user, output are then passed on to `Ui` for display. 
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `PostponeAction#act()` - Postpone the deadline or event task by the chosen parameter.
* `PostponeAction#prepare()` - Parse user command to suitable parameter for `PostponeAction#act()` function.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the postpone mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `postpone [index]` command to postpone the targeted task. Command is then parsed by `PostponeAction#prepare()` to be passed as arguments for `PostponeAction#act()`.

Step 2. `PostponeAction#act()` re-sets the date of the targeted task from the stored user's tasks by default a day.

Step 3. `PostponeAction#act()` then updates the stored user's data.

Step 4. Postponed target task is returned to the user through `Ui`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![Postpone_Sequence_Diagram](Images/PostponeAction_Sequence_Diagram.png)

### 4.8 Focus Feature

The proposed focus mechanism is facilitated by `FocusAction`. It extends `Action` to execute command given by the user, output are then passed on to `Ui` for display. 
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `FocusAction#act()` - Sets the task flag by the chosen parameter.
* `FocusAction#prepare()` - Parse user command to suitable parameter for `PostponeAction#act()` function.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the focus mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `focus [task type]` command to filter based on task type. Command is then parsed by `FocusAction#prepare()` to be passed as arguments for `FocusAction#act()`.

Step 2. `FocusAction#act()` then sets flag in the data.

Step 3. Changed context is returned to inform the user through `Ui`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![Postpone_Sequence_Diagram](Images/Focus.png)

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as Model#commitAddressBook(), Model#undoAddressBook() and Model#redoAddressBook() respectively.
